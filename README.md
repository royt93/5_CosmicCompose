# ðŸŽ¨ Cosmic Compose

Cosmic Compose is a minimal Android app made with **Jetpack Compose**. Everything has been drawn on
a 2D canvas, and animated using Compose's animation API. Shading has been achieved using a few
hacks. ;)

#### In a nutshell

The Light source, ie. Sun, is drawn using a simple Radial Gradient. Every other planet is a
different composable 'placed' at different locations on the screen. Within each planet, there are
(radius)^2 points being rendered. Each point has its own lightness and alpha value, which gives us
the shaded look.
