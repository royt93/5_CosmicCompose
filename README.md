# ðŸŽ¨ Cosmic Compose

Cosmic Compose is a minimal Android app made with **Jetpack Compose**. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of Layout Composable. Everything has been drawn using Canvas, and animated using Compose's animation API. Shading has been achieved using a few
hacks. ;)

#### In a nutshell

The Light source, ie. Sun, is drawn using a simple Radial Gradient. Every other planet is a
different composable 'placed' at different locations on the screen. Within each planet, there are
(radius)^2 points being rendered. Each point has its own lightness and alpha value, which gives us
the shaded look.
